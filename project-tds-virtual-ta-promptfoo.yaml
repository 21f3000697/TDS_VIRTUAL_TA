prompts:
  - Should I use gpt-4o-mini which AI proxy supports, or gpt3.5 turbo?
  - If I passed 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0125' to the model, how many cents would the input cost if the cost per million tokens is 50 cents?
  - How do I calculate the number of tokens and cost?
  - What model should I use for the assignment?
  - How do I use the tokenizer like Prof. Anand showed?
